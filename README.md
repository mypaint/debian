## Renamed and split

This debianization has been renamed and split into the following
repositories and branches:

* [libmypaint](https://github.com/mypaint/libmypaint.deb)
* [mypaint.deb (master)](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint.deb)
* [mypaint.deb (v1.2.x)](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint.deb/tree/v1.2.x)

To build MyPaint from git master, you now need to build libmypaint and
install it first.
